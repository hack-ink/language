## Introduction
Language tags are defined in [BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).

An introduction can be found in the article ["Language tags in HTML and XML"](http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/) by the W3C.

These tags are commonly used in HTML and in the `Content-Language` and `Accept-Language` header fields of HTTP.

I primarily use this in my [AiR](https://github.com/hack-ink/AiR) project to support multiple languages.

There are already many similar crates, but none provide `as_tag`, `from_tag`, `as_str`, and `as_local` at the same time. So, I implemented this myself.
